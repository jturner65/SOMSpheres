# SOMSpheres
(Java/Processing/Somoclu)Experiments to map 3d sphere centers and surface samples to a SOM and evaluate the results

This project is a Java Eclipse project using the Processing core librarires for graphics functionality and a customized version of the SOMOCLU library for the Self Organizing Map functionality.  Everything necessary to import this project into Eclipse and run it should be present.

This project is intended to provide a mechanism to gain some understanding of Self Organizing Maps.  Spheres of random, user-determinable sizes can be generated, with samples on their surfaces, and a SOM can be configured and trained on these spheres, or their samples.  The resultant weight-space of the SOM is then displayed, as well as the partitions of that space corresponding to specific spheres.
